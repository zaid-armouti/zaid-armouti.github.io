                <article>
                <p> project was made using pure javaScrip. The idea idea of this project was to provide a motevational message to the usear each time the program runs.
                    The code can be easily edited to add more messages. In the future i might add a section where the user can add messages to our database.

                    <p>This project was really challenging for me; it took me more than 2 days to finish and to be honest I still think I can do better.
                        Personally I enjoy sitting at a cozy place drinkingmy cup of coffee maybe with a little jazz to elevate the mood.<br>
                        It was challenging but though me so much on flex-box concept. <a href="tea cozy/tea-cozy.html">The Tea Cozy</a>
